    \ effectively assess the credit worthiness of businesses. The reports contain\
    \ a score, which provides the likelihood of a late payment, default or total company\
    \ failure and enables instant and/or automated decisioning in real-time.There\
    \ are two reports to choose from, offering flexibility on the level of information\
    \ required. \n\n# Getting started\n  1. **<a href=\"/user/to-be-determined\" target=\"\
